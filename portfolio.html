      <h3>Portable Virtual-Reality PC</h3>
      <p>In 2017 I was given the opportunity to build a PC for CompTIA's latest interactive education experiement. An app was in development that would utilize VR to train students in PC Hardware. I was tasked with planning and building a PC that could meet the processing demands while being portable enough to take to conferences.</p>
