# Project 1
###### By: Jacob Huebner - ITMD 361 Fall 2018 

In Project 1 you must create 3 webpages. One page is a professional resume and the two other are up to your choice. The pages must include a good amount of content and adhere to strict guidelines and HTML standards. 

## Goals

* Write standards-compliant HTML-5
* Use HTML validator to assure compliance
* Track the development of a project over time and collaborate with others using Basecamp

## Deliverables & Milestones


1. [ ] **First Deliverable:** Create a Basecamp post describing your work in progress. Title the post with your name and project number (example Daniel Krieglstein: Project 1). Your post should include:
* The URL to your GitHub repository, and the URL to your Github Pages live link
* Two questions eliciting feedback on from fellow students

2. [ ] **Second Deliverable:** Give constructive comments to help at least three other students.

3. [ ] **Third Deliverable:** Edit your original Basecamp post under Project 1 by fixing your code based on feedback from the professor and fellow students. Additionally, add the following:
Add a 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point

## Requirements

- [x] NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style in your content page.
- [x] Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indtned 2 space right of its parent.
- [x] alid, well-formed semantic HTML5. Projects whose HTML does not validate with the W3C HTML validator will receive a -50% point loss.
- [x] Absolutely no br tags, use of tables for layout, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page layout. (All layout and design will be handled via CSS in the next project. For this project, I urge you not to spend much time at all looking at your pages in a browser. Stick close to your source code and the HTML validator.)
- [x] A navigation area for accessing each of your projectâ€™s pages from any other page
- [x] Include at least two different forms of media (image, audio, video) in your project
- [x] No code-generators like WYSIWYGs, Bootstrap, or other off-the-shelf frameworks
- [x] Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. "https://dkriegls.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.css"
- [x] A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make
- [x] Git repository must contain only the files and commits from this project. Each website you make for this class should have its own repository.
