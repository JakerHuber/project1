# Project 1
###### By: Jacob Huebner - ITMD 361 Fall 2018 

In Project 1 you must create 3 webpages. One page is a professional resume and the two other are up to your choice. The pages must include a good amount of content and adhere to strict guidelines and HTML standards. 


## Instructions
```
Process:

1. Using your text editor, create a new plain text file and save it as “index.html”. If your editor asks for encoding you want “UTF-8”.  

2. Start by adding the proper HTML5 Skeleton Structure to the document as we discussed in class. 

3. Use the lab3source.txt file as the source text for your html page. Use the lab3.png image as a guide on how the page should look. Make intelligent decisions on what HTML tags to use where. 

4. Hints: notice the table of title and author at the top and the bulleted list at the bottom of the page. Put your name in the spot labeled “Student’s Name”. 

5. Your page, when viewed in your browser, should look similar to the lab3.png file. HTML text should flow with different sized browsers, so text breaks might not be exactly the same.

6. Upload your finished HTML page to a fresh Github repository. Then create a Basecamp post under the “Labs” page. Title with “Your Name: Lab 3” and link to your lab 3 repository and live link.
